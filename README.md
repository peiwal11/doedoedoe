This project involves combining Nginx and Python servers within Docker containers.

Use the build.sh script in the ngi directory to build the Nginx image. Don't forget to use chmod +x build.sh to make sure build.sh is executable.

Use the build.sh script in the py directory to build the Python server image. Also, remember to make the script executable by revising it accordingly.

Finally, run the docker-compose.yml file in the py directory to start both services at once.
